Here are queries for things involving agents. Explanations below.

**MultipleAgentsToResource**
This query will allow you to check for a resource that has specific multiple agents you need. The origin of this query were records with incorrectly linked agents/roles for the resource.

_What is going on?_
* A couple of tables with long names (`name_corporate_entity`, `agent_corporate_entity`) use aliases throughout the query to save typing and such. For more information on aliases and how they work, you can [read here](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_alias.asp "SQL ALIAS syntax")
* For ease, you are probably going to want to have the resource record title and other identifiers. I include the title and EAD id which are from the `resource` table. I use EAD IDs because they are the most sensible for us to use for human readability, but if that is not true for you, or if you don't actually use EAD IDs, remove `resource.ead_id` and swap in `resource.identifier` as that will most likely be your call number/shelf mark
* The original query was written for two specific corporate entities. This requires using the `name_corporate_entity` table. I called on the name (`primary_name`). 
* The relationship between the corporate agent and the resource is stored in another table, `linked_agent_rlshp`. While you may not actually need to know the ID number for the agent, you need to call this table in order to later do the join. So I called on the `agent_corporate_entity_id`. For clarifying purposes for this specific issue, I added the `role_id` as well. `role_id` has the ID number for the Agent role (creator, source, subject). If you don't need this information, delete it.
* If you are using `lar.role_id`, an ID number for the role is probably not useful if you don't have their enumeration memorized. Enumerations of ID numbers for `role_id` and other similar type descriptions (e.g. `date.date_type_id`, `resource.language_id`) is stored in the `enumeration_value` table. Therefore, you will want to call the `enumeration_value.value` to get the actual role name. Again, if you don't need the role, feel free to delete this.
* The `FROM` table in this case is `linked_agent_rlshp` since we're concerned with the linking here.
* The `LEFT JOIN`s are based on all the common columns of data. All of the tables can be joined in this case based on the `linked_agent_rlshp` table. For more information on `LEFT JOIN`, you can [read here] (https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_join_left.asp "SQL LEFT JOIN syntax)
* For the `WHERE` clause, we're starting with the agents we need to find together. We have the names, so we're sorting first on the `name_corporate_entity` table with the agents names. Then, we want them to be organized by the resources their attached to. Finally we only want the resources with both of those subject headings and not one or the other. So we are counting resources with the two of them listed. For more information on `HAVING COUNT`, you can [read here](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_having.asp "SQL HAVING syntax")
